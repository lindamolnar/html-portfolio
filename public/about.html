<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Linda Molnar. I am currently a second-year student at the Faculty of Mathematics in Belgrade, majoring in Computer Science. 
  I am very interested in programming and am currently learning about web development. 
  I want to develop in many directions, but above all, to learn even more about programming skills and to become an expert one day. 
  That is why, in addition to college, I am dedicated to acquiring new knowledge and experiences that will provide me with new opportunities.</p>

<p>In addition to programming, my great passions are painting and playing the piano. 
  Oil painting is my hobby when I want to take a break from programming. 
  I'm also interested in texture art, which I'm a complete beginner at.</p>
